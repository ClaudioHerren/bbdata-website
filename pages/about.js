        text1: 'A system is said “complex” when it is composed of many intertwined subsystems and for which it is difficult to establish simple rules explaining its behavior/evolution. The research Institute for Complex Systems defines its scope in this emerging field for which informatics, intelligent data analysis, massively distributed computing, mathematical modeling and systems engineering are the main supports.',
        text2: 'Current research activities and achievements are in environmental applications, smart buildings, energy management, pathology detection, intelligent wireless networks, smart mobility or event detection in video surveillance. The institute specializes in areas such as massive information processing, cloud computing, machine learning, business intelligence and signal processing.'
