        title: 'Facility 4.0',
        subtitle: 'Innovative Building Management',
        text: 'This project is part of the energy transition and the reduction of the environmental impact from the building sector, which accounts for a third of the CO2 emissions in Switzerland and around 45% of energy consumption. The question of monitoring and optimising the performance of the 2.3 million buildings in Switzerland is therefore central.',

        subtitle: 'Measuring, interpreting and representing the pulse of the city',
        text: 'Road traffic has a sizeable impact on the comfort and quality of life in our neighborhoods and cities, notably on air quality and noise pollution. The recent evolutions in sensors, communication networks and BigData analytics open new perspectives in the measurement and analysis of those impacts. The CityPulse project aims to offer a live, localized and continuous measurement of the city through the installation of a network of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. This project is realized in collaboration with the Smart Living Lab (SLL), a long-term project which aims to develop the neighborhoods of the future.',

        text: 'The Smart Living Lab brings together the combined expertise of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg (HEIA-FR), and the University of Fribourg (UNIFR) in research areas such as construction technologies, well-being and behaviors, interactions and design processes, and energy systems. The Smart Living Lab has been conducting research in the blueFACTORY innovation district in Fribourg since the end of 2015, and the construction phase for its own new building on the same site is slated for 2020.',

        title: 'Smart Reactor',
        subtitle: 'Real-time anomaly detection in chemical reactors',
        text: 'Following the Industry 4.0 trend, industrial grade chemical reactors tend nowadays to be equipped with sensors that are tracking different parameters such as temperature, use of vacuum, nitrogen, water vapor. In these configurations, sensors are producing time-series data that can be used to perform automated detection of abnormal events and to monitor the chemical reactions. Abnormal events have heterogeneous sources such as human errors, valves malfunctions or exhaustion of energy sources. Abnormal situations can go undetected and may lead to bad quality of production or even dangerous situations.',
